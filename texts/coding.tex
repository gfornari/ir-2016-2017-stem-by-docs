    \subsection{Difficulties}
        We had some difficulties in the understanding of the computation of RCO. At the first time, in fact, we didn't understand that the RCO had to be computed on all the words that had a cooccorence: instead, we considered all the words grouped in the same graph using the previous clustering. In fact, the paper state:
        \begin{quotation}
            ``Here we consider the word pairs (a, b) for which CO(a, b) > 0.''
        \end{quotation}
        For this reason, our first implementation was wrong: we had then some delay to complete our first prototype before deadline \ref{firstDeadline}, and we started the second period after we planned.
