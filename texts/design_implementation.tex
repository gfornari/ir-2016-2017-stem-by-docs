    \subsection{Technologies}
        We chose to develop our project using Java. This programming language has many open source libraries and large active communities with millions of users. Moreover, programs written in Java are portable and therefore platform-independent.\par

        In order to make the management of our Java-based project easier, we chose to use Maven\footnotemark{}. This tool provides a uniform build system and guidelines for best practices development. Moreover, Maven is exceptionally good at managing external dependencies.\par
