\section{Activity report}
We report here a brief activity summary accompanied by the measures of the time effort.

The activities carried out are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item study and understand of the paper, point out the potential difficulties of the implementation;
    \item algorithm implementation along with the tools study (e.g. Terrier);
    \item evaluation of the Information Retrieval System (IRS);
    \item writing of the final report.
\end{enumerate}

   \begin{tabular}{| l | c | c |}
    \hline
    & Hours & Percentage\\ \hline
    Paper study & 7 & 17\%\\ \hline
    Implementation & 15 & 37\%\\ \hline
    Evaluation & 13 & 32\%\\ \hline
    Report & 6 & 15\%\\ \hline
    Total & 41 & 100\%\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

The work has been equally distributed on each team member. The roles and the activities have been rotated to ensure best learning, sharing of ideas, outcome verification, and ultimately quality of the work.

From the Table \ref{tab:activities}, we can see that the two activities which required more effort are the implementation and the evaluation. It makes sense from the problems discussed in section \ref{sec:memory-management}, and considering the importance of evaluating an IRS. The paper study reports a 17\% of the total effort due to our attempt to identify the computational problems which would have come out later on.
